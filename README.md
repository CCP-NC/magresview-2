# magresview-2
MagresView 2.0 - NMR crystallography visualisation app

### Running a local copy

If you want to run MagresView 2.0 (offline) on your local machine, you need to get the `gh-pages` branch of the code as this contains the pre-built app. 

You can get the current version here:

https://github.com/CCP-NC/magresview-2/archive/refs/heads/gh-pages.zip

Once downloaded, you no longer need an internet connection. You simply unzip the file, which will create a directory called `magresview-2-gh-pages`; in that you'll find an `index.html` file. Opening this in the browser of your choice starts the app. 

**Alternatively**, if you prefer, you can instead use [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) to download the `gh-pages` branch:

`git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/CCP-NC/magresview-2.git`
 
This will create a directory called `magresview-2` within which you'll find the `index.html` file.
