# magresview-2
MagresView 2.0 - NMR crystallography visualisation app

### Running a local copy

If you want to run MagresView 2.0 (offline) on your local machine, you need to get the `gh-pages` branch of the code. For example, to clone only this branch, use this command:

`git clone -b gh-pages git@github.com:CCP-NC/magresview-2.git`
 
Within the created magresview-2 directory, there is an index.html file. Opening this in your browser of choice starts the app.
